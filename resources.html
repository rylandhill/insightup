  <h3 class="subheader">LDL-P</h3>
  <h5 class="subsubheader">LDL-P stands for Low-Density Lipoprotein Particle. It's a way to measure the number of LDL particles in your blood, rather than just the amount of cholesterol they carry. LDL particles are often considered the "bad" cholesterol particles because when there are too many of them, they can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries, which can increase your risk of heart disease.</h5>
  <h3 class="subheader">LDL-C</h3>
  <h5 class="subsubheader">LDL-C stands for Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol. It's often referred to as the "bad" cholesterol. LDL-C specifically measures the amount of cholesterol carried by LDL particles in your blood. High levels of LDL-C can contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.</h5>
  <h3 class="subheader">HDL-C</h3>
  <h5 class="subsubheader">HDL-C stands for High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol. It's often called the "good" cholesterol. HDL-C specifically measures the amount of cholesterol carried by HDL particles in your blood. High levels of HDL-C are associated with a lower risk of heart disease because HDL helps remove excess cholesterol from your blood vessels, reducing the risk of plaque buildup.</h5>
  <h3 class="subheader">HDL-P Total</h3>
  <h5 class="subsubheader">HDL-P (total) measures the total number of HDL particles in your blood. Having a higher number of HDL particles is generally considered beneficial for heart health because it means there are more carriers available to remove cholesterol from your bloodstream.</h5>
  <h3 class="subheader">Triglyceride</h3>
  <h5 class="subsubheader">Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides, which are stored in fat cells. Later, hormones release triglycerides for energy between meals. High triglyceride levels can increase your risk of heart disease and other health problems, so it's important to keep them in check.</h5>
  <h3 class="subheader">Total Cholesterol</h3>
  <h5 class="subsubheader">Total cholesterol levels measure the combined amount of different types of cholesterol in your blood. Cholesterol is a waxy substance that's essential for building cells and making hormones, but too much of it, especially certain types, can increase the risk of heart disease.</h5>
  <h3 class="subheader">Small LDL-P</h3>
  <h5 class="subsubheader">Small LDL-P levels refer to the number of small, dense Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) particles in your blood. These particles are considered more harmful than larger LDL particles because they are more likely to penetrate the walls of your arteries and contribute to the buildup of plaque, which can lead to heart disease.</h5>
  <h3 class="subheader">LDL Size</h3>
  <h5 class="subsubheader">LDL size refers to the size of the Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) particles in your blood. These particles can vary in size, and it's believed that smaller, denser LDL particles may be more harmful than larger ones. Smaller LDL particles are thought to be more harmful because they can more easily penetrate the walls of your arteries and contribute to plaque buildup, increasing the risk of heart disease.</h5>
  <h3 class="subheader">LP-IR Score</h3>
  <h5 class="subsubheader">The LP-IR score is a measure of insulin resistance, which is when your body's cells don't respond well to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood sugar levels and, over time, increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and other health issues.</h5>
